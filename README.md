My own personal maze and website.

Ideas:

Website starts by fading into looking through website through eyes, eyes change and show room .guy blinking looking around and is chased by a bunch of mice. . The mice tracks your mouse and runs after you. If it catches you, game over retry. If you click, you shoot and it makes real gun sound and muzzle flash. Make sure muzzle flash shows actual lighting.
